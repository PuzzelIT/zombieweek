  continue.

- There is a bug that makes the player spawn under the table in the second world.


2. Reports (15 min) from previous meeting

- Erik has made it so the zombies move towards the player using the A* algorithm. 
He made it so the zombies can be placed in tiled and so that they can rotate. 

- Tobias changed the body of the player so it has the same shape as the player. He also wrote on the SDD and the RAD. He also started on a game over view.

- Neda has made attack work. She also fixed many small things such that the zombie gets attacked when the book hits it first. She has also worked on the use cases. 

- Daniel worked on the flashlight. He also added a grenade class. He also added a red screen when the player gets hit by the zombies.
