1. Objectives (5 min). Resolve any issues preventing the team to
  continue.

- There is a bug that makes the player spawn under the table in the second world.


2. Reports (15 min) from previous meeting

- Erik has made it so the zombies move towards the player using the dijkstra algorithm. 
He made it  so the zombies can be placed in tiled and so that they can rotate. 

- Tobias changed the body of the plyer so it has the same shape as the player. He also wrote on the SDD and the RAD.
He also started on a game over view.

- Neda has made attack work. She also fixed many small things such that the zombie gets attacked when the book hits it first.
She has also worked on the use cases. 

- Daniel worked on the flashlight. He also added a grenade class. He also added a red screen when the player gets hit by the zombies.

3. Discussion items (35 min)

- We need to refactor more, to make it more like MVC. 
- The documentation needs to be updated.
- The book should have feedback.
- It would be nice to add grenades and potions to the game.
- A timer would help make the game more unique.
- The HUD needs an update.

4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min)

- Neda will update the use cases. She will work on attack and spawn methods in ZombieController as well as uploading more levels. 
- Erik will help Neda with the zombie movement and spawning. He will also create tile maps for the new levels. 
- Daniel will complete the flashlight class.
- Tobias will help Daniel with flashlight/pause menu bug fixing. He will also remake the entity bodies more fit to the sprites. He will furthermore work on documentation.

5. Wrap up
- The book bug is low priority and will have to wait.
